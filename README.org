* ChatGPT Invoker Emacs interface

ChatGPT is awsome and there has been and there will be more emacs packages
that provide interfaces to it.

In February of 2023, I, Mohsen BANAN, tried to get something working for myself.
What I ended up with is a temporary solution that lets me use ChatGPT in a very
basic way. For now it is just a bandaid and it is not clean.

Over the next several months I expect that much cleaner emacs packages will be
produced. At which time, I'll switch.

Here is a summary of my journey.

This packaging has only been tested with Blee.

In order to have it work with vanila emacs or Doom or etc, you may have to
modify various things and you are on your own for that.

* List Of Existing  ChatGPT Invoker Emacs interfaces

As of Feb 2023, the following packages were located.

** https://github.com/joshcho/ChatGPT.el --- With Python chatgpt-wrapper

I pip installed the python side and got the python chatgpt to work.

The elisp interface to epc, did not work for me. It just hung.

For integration of service invokers into emacs, I like the external python
approach best. So, I will likely be coming back to this later.

** https://github.com/emacs-openai/codegpt --- With OpenAI library

Tried that and it did not work for me.

** Gavin Jaeger-Freeborn  https://gist.github.com/Gavinok/a18e0b2dac74e4ae67df35e45a170f7f

It worked for me. But it was not packaged and like the other two did not have a
a menu. So, I have packaged it here and have added a menu to it as well.

The ./chatgpt.el i sessentially a copy of Gavin's.
Here are the things that I added:
- The end result buffer is now subjected to a fill-region
- There is top level menu, that makes it easier to use.

* Package installation

** Blee Installation

#+begin_src
    (b:pkg:straight|profiledInstall
       b:pkgsProfile:native
     '(chatGptInv :type git :host github :repo "bx-blee/chatGptInv"))))
#+end_src

** Straight Installation

#+begin_src
(use-package chatGptInv
  :straight (:host github :repo "bx-blee/chatGptInv"))
#+end_src

But, I have not tested it. It may not work.

To use this extension, you will need an API key from OpenAI. To obtain one,
